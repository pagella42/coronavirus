## Corona virus test

This is a web page that was designed in a few days, in order to support the arising coronavirus crisis in Argentina.
It was launched to offer people a tool that would guide them into knowing their current situation, and avoid overcrowding hospitals.

This web page is not operating publicly anymore since the Goverment has launched their own tool.
But it can still be accesed with this link https://coronavirus-test-online.herokuapp.com

The code is now open source and publicly accessible.
